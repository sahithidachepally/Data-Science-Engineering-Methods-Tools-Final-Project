Cybersecurity Salary Analysis: Modeling and Explaining Salary Variation Using Statistical Methods

This project examines the key factors that influence cybersecurity salaries using a globally sourced
dataset of 1,247 professionals. As cybersecurity continues to emerge as one of the fastest-growing
technology fields, understanding salary variation is critical for compensation transparency,
workforce planning, and equitable career growth. This study aims to identify how experience,
remote-work flexibility, company size, and work arrangements contribute to differences in annual
salary, measured as salary_in_usd.
To address these questions, three statistical methods are applied. First, a Multiple Linear
Regression model evaluates how two quantitative predictors, experience level (converted into an
ordinal numeric scale) and remote-work ratio jointly influence salary. Second, a One-Way ANOVA
examines differences in salary across three company-size categories (Small, Medium, Large).
Third, a Two-Way ANOVA investigates the interaction between experience level and remote-work
status (remote vs. non-remote), allowing for assessment of combined effects.
Key findings indicate that salary increases consistently with higher experience levels, and remote
roles tend to offer higher compensation, likely due to global hiring and access to international
salary standards. Company size also plays a significant role, with large companies offering
significantly higher salaries than small and mid-sized firms. The interaction analysis reveals that
remote work amplifies the salary advantage for senior and expert-level professionals.
These insights provide practical implications for job seekers, HR departments, and policymakers,
enabling data-driven decisions related to compensation benchmarking, workforce development,
and remote-work strategies
